DIGLO is my **dig**ital **lo**gic simulator. \
I made it because i couldn't find a simple and resource friendly Logic Simulator

### How To Use?
You start with only one logic gate and thats the NAND gate. \
Why? Because you can make every logic gate with only NAND gates so it's the only thing you'll need. \
There is also I/O (Input/Output) if you wanted to make integrated circuits.

Once you've built your first circuit, use CTRL (⌘) + S to save it.
Give it a name, choose a color and press SAVE.

You can also use CTRL (⌘) + O to open saved circuits, CTRL (⌘) + N to create a new circuit and CTRL (⌘) + H for help. \
These shortcuts can also be found in the MENU.

### Why Only NAND?
Ngl i think that most simulators have too much stuff that you don't use anyway so you don't need it. \
I also think that you should make it all yourself so you know how everything works and than use those ICs for larger circuits.

### Credits
I got the inspiration to make this after i used [Sebastian Lagues](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) [Digital Logic Sim 2](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim) for a month, but it was just too resource intensive and laggy for my mac. I really liked the simulator because it was very simple and gave you only two gates (and some hidden ones) and didn't have any of the complex features i didn't need. \
I tried other simulators, but they were all too complicated, non-user friendly, didn't have dark mode (which i need) or just were unstable. (also some were only for windows)

## Known Issues
- There's currently no way to create ICs
- When you toggle an input it moves
- I/O chips can't be renamed
